# WeatherPy: Exploring Weather Trends

## Overview
This project analyzes weather patterns across various global cities using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It demonstrates how weather variables such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed correlate with latitude. The insights are useful for businesses, travelers, and climate researchers.

## Data Source
- **Geographic coordinates:** Randomly generated using NumPy

- **City names:** Identified using the Citipy library

- **Weather data:** Fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API

## Tools & Techniques Used
### Data Acquisition
Used NumPy to generate random latitude and longitude values

Identified the nearest cities using Citipy

Fetched real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API

### Data Preparation
Cleaned the data by handling missing values and API request failures

Extracted relevant weather attributes: temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, country, and date

Converted timestamp data into human-readable format

Stored the final dataset in a structured Pandas DataFrame

### Data Analysis & Visualization
Explored relationships between latitude and key weather attributes

Created scatter plots to visualize trends:

- **Latitude vs. Temperature:** Examined how temperature varies with latitude

Used Matplotlib for clear, insightful visualizations

## Linear Regression Analysis
Linear regression was performed separately for cities in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

- R-value: 0.8321341504647478

**Key Insights: Latitude vs. Temperature**

- The closer a city is to the equator, the warmer it tends to be. On the other hand, temperatures drop as you move toward the North or South Pole. This pattern is clear in both hemispheres, but itâ€™s slightly stronger in the Southern Hemisphere.

- One possible reason is that the Southern Hemisphere has more ocean, which helps keep temperatures more stable. In contrast, the Northern Hemisphere has more land, leading to bigger temperature changes.

- However, not all cities follow this pattern exactly. Some are warmer or colder than expected due to things like altitude, ocean currents, or local weather. This shows that while latitude is important, other factors also play a role in temperature.
